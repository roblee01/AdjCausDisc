\title{AdjDAG}
\usage{
AdjDAG(A)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{The adjacency matrix that shows us the structure of the DAG. The input should be a lower triangular matrix where the possible matrix entry can only be 0}
}
\value{
The plot of the Directed Acyclic Graph that is described within the adjacency matrix
}
\description{
Uses the information in the Adjacency Matrix, which informs us of where the directed edges are presents, to create the Directed Acyclic Graph visualization
}
\examples{
Adjacency_matrix = matrix(nrow=3,ncol=3,0)
Adjacency_matrix[,1]=c(0,1,1)
Adjacency_matrix[,2]=c(0,0,1)
Adjacency_matrix[,3]=c(0,0,0)
AdjDAG(Adjacency_matrix)
}
